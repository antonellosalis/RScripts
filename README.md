# RScripts
Scripts collection used to analyze and report forest datasets.
The input file I use is normally CSV
I spent a lot of time trying to obtain graphics automatically, this is very usefull if you have like hundreds of sample plots and you want to 
display basical description of each plot (e.g. species composition, outliars, funny things).
Please enjoy it, copy it, clone it, improve it.
