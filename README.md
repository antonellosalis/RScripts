# RScripts
Scripts collection used to map, analyze and report forest datasets and other datasources.
The input file I use is normally CSV or TIF.
I spent a lot of time trying to obtain graphics automatically, this is very usefull if you have like hundreds of sample plots and you want to 
display basical description of each plot (e.g. species composition, outliars, funny things).
Please enjoy it, copy it, clone it, improve it.
